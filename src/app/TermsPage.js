      <p>
        Thank you for using TzStats.com (the “Website”). This page contains the terms that apply to your use of the
        Website (the “Terms”).&nbsp; The Site is owned and operated by KIDTSUNAMI UG. (“KIDTSUNAMI,” “we,” or “us”).

        applications, API, data exports and widgets (collectively, the “Platform,” and together with the Data, the
        “Services”).
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Service govern your use of the Site and the Services, and may be updated by us from time to time

        <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which is hereby incorporated by reference (collectively with these Terms
        of Service, this “Agreement”). If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not access or use the

        illustrations, audio clips and video clips), copying Content directly from the Site, through export data files
        or other data dumps directly from KIDTSUNAMI, or through the TzStats API (which will enable you to build
        applications on top of the Platform). KIDTSUNAMI may change, suspend or discontinue the Services for any reason,
        at any time, including the availability of any feature or Content. KIDTSUNAMI may also restrict your access to
        parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.

      <p>
        KIDTSUNAMI will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Platform is available twenty-four hours a day, seven
        days a week. However, there will be occasions when the Services will be interrupted for Platform maintenance,
        upgrades and emergency repairs or due to failure of telecommunications links and equipment.
